# Terminal application for TI silent 700 with broken keys

We have a TI silent 700, and we wanted to connect it to something useful.

Unfortunately it only sends in uppercase so using it as a modern day terminal alone is sort of out of the question. So this application allows us to run and develop applications for it which are vaguely useful.

## Developing an application

Make a new class somewhere in `apps/`. Inherit `TerminalApp`, follow the docstring.

Use `python mainterminal.py --dummy` to prototype.
